Please contact me jalberge&lt;at&gt;broadinstitute&lt;dot&gt;org for feedback and suggestions. 1.1 Pre-requisites To achieve this practical work, we will use a collection of R packages called tidyverse, available with R version ≥ 4. We recommend using the Rstudio software as a development environment. R is a language and a calculator. Rstudio is a graphical development environment built on top of R. Tidyverse is a collection of R packages commonly used for data science. To download and install R, please follow instruction at the Comprehensive R Archive Network: https://cran.r-project.org/ To download and install Rstudio Desktop, go to https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and hit the Download Rstudio Desktop for &lt;MacOS/Linux/Windows&gt;. Once RStudio and R are installed, open RSudio and run the following command to install the tidyverse collection of R packages. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Finally, load the tidyverse R packages within your current R environment with the command below. If this command works fine, you should be all set to start using R! library(tidyverse) 1.2 Good practices Here are some good practices to write R code. They will help you write clear and maintainable code. Comment your code with # statements a &lt;- choose(5, 2) # computes binomial coefficients Avoid obvious comments x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 1 # if x is greather than y, then print x if (x&gt;y) print(x) ## [1] 2 Group your code by task # assign values x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 1 # compute statements if (x&gt;y) print(x) ## [1] 2 Use a consistent naming scheme # good ! sum.two.elements &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x+y) } multiply.two.elements &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x*y) } # bad ! my.function.bis &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x+y) } test.function &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x*y) } DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Automate repetitive tasks. The same piece of code should not be repeated, but reused. Limit line length Set your working directory where you store all the code and the results setwd(‘C:/Users/JohnDoe/MM_R_Codebook/’) Should you receive any error message from the R console, make sure you’ve read it and googled it carefully before going crazy.
